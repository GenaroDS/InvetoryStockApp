# StockApp
This is another CRUD application, but in a webpage and with an h2 database. Once you create your user, you proced to log in and then each product crated belows to the current loged in user. You can also delete, or modify each created product. Down below there are some images of the app use cycle. For variety the screenshots were taken on my phone to show its responsiveness.

<div style="display: inline-block;">
  <img src="/Apphotos/LoginView.jpg" alt="Login View" width="190"/>
  <img src="/Apphotos/RegisterView.jpg" alt="Register View" width="190"/>

And here are the changes reflected on the database:
