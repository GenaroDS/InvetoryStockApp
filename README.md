# StockApp
This is a CRUD application designed for the web, using an H2 database. After creating a user account, you can log in and create products, which will be associated with the logged-in user. You can also delete or modify any of the products you create. Below are some images demonstrating the app's use cycle. To showcase its responsiveness, the screenshots were taken using a mobile phone.
